## Prologue
So many lessons are learned when you begin planning work across many different organisations and people. I share
my experience thus far in this article, my hope is to keep this a living document for myself.


## Lessons Learned
### Speed is critical

At the beginning of any project, speed is key. Being able to traverse through problems faster than anyone else is the 
easy way to gain leverage and visibility. You must see your deadlines as suggestions, not timelines but work towards them with a sense of urgency.

The confusion here I seek to clarify is that speed must be met with care, take your time and balance execution with precision. No one remembers your best days but they will always
remember your bad days.

### Delivery matters (more?)

Your ability to deliver will always be met with speculation, that Godfather style "sizing you up" will happen across different people
you engage with day-to-day. Whilst it benefits you to appear faultless, it is an almost impossible outcome with high expectations, you will make mistakes.

Adopt instead the approach to work on your delivery, improve your ability to meet different stakeholders where they need to be met.
This will over time take skill but it is your job to understand your audience before meeting them.

### Keep your stakeholders aligned, not happy

A common mistake I made early was thinking I could make my stakeholders happy, I collected their feedback and tried to find ways
to merge it all into a "go-to-the-moon" happy plan. This however brought frustrations as it appears there was never a stable moment
with the "happy plan", their point of happiness drifted faster than the second timer on my watch.

Keeping stakeholders aligned means meeting them at a point you can deliver at and a point they can accept, there is no happy path when multiple people
are concerned with a problem, adopt diplomacy instead and piss some people off. They'd forget about it in the coming week anyways ;-).

### Set expectations very early

This might appear the same as "Keep your stakeholders aligned, not happy" but setting expectations is for everyone around you.
Your perception is your reality and setting expectations is something you must realise from day 1. 
- Want to be the chill guy who is great at mentoring and open to ideas? Go for it. 
- Want to be the uncompromising lunatic on attention to detail? Be my guest.
- Want to be the coaster who comes around when folks are done arguing? Here's an extended lunch break.

Teams are not a one-fits-all approach but setting expectations is the best way to ensure that when your skills are needed, leadership knows
who to call to handle those problems.

A good path here is to read DHH's article on [Commit to competence in the coming year](https://world.hey.com/dhh/commit-to-competence-in-this-coming-year-feb7d7c5/?utm_source=newsletter)

### Let others fight your battles, know your pay grade

There is this inflection point when you move from being an IC that code solves your problems after keeping yourself oblivious; there exists a lifestyle about living in the politics
of change and the organisation at wide. 

Once you transition into leading initiatives, you will at-some-point meet a random bloke who does not like you
because your boss pissed them off some years ago and you're now stuck driving the far end of the stick the wrong way.

Believing you're responsible for a solution here is the false case of ownership, this is far beyond your pay grade and requires context 
you are rarely going to understand. Leave these alternating problems for upper management to figure out, they get paid to do it for you.


And, finally...

### Remember work is a means to an end

As far as work goes, work is a lifestyle but it is a means to an end. It pays the bills and gives you satisfaction but it not the intention of your
self-worth. Balance the scales and enjoy the moment, you'd live longer.
